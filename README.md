## Instructions

The Little person starts at the bottom of the screen. The person playing the game uses the arrow keys to move the frog in one of 4 directions: up, down, left, and right. The object of the game is to direct the little perspon onto the water. To do this, the little person must avoid the bugs while crossing the pavement and navigate to the river.
