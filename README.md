## How-To-Run

To install the game, download or clone the repository from GitHub to your machine. Open the downloaded or cloned repository on your device using a text editor. Launch the index.html file on your browser and begin playing.

## Instructions

The Little person starts at the bottom of the screen. The person playing the game uses the arrow keys to move the person in one of 4 directions: up, down, left, and right. The object of the game is to direct the little perspon onto the water. To do this, the little person must avoid the bugs while crossing the pavement and navigate to the river. Once the person has crossed an alert will appear and let the player know they have won!
